		This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Bug reports are to be
		submitted in the GitHub issue tracker.

		Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your
		report, reproduce it and find related reports.

		<!--
		Show how some bugs can turn out to not be bugs
		-->
		**Before submitting a bug report**
		- First of all, test with the latest update release to see if the issue persists.
			Frequently, a bug report submitted for an older release is first suggested
			to test with the available latest update release or even an available
			latest beta release.
		<!-- - If you have a debugging guide or an FAQ, link to it here -->
		- Make sure that your code is proper.
		- Investigate a bit more and see if you can pinpoint what exactly causes the issue.
		- Search and check if the issue has already been reported. If it has, then just
		  leave a comment on the issue with more information about the bug. If the
		  issue has been closed, open a new issue with a link to the old one.

		**Submitting a good bug report**
		As stated above, bugs are tracked using GitHub issues. Fill in the issue
		template when you create an issue.

		Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:
		- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
		  Title it "[Bug]: Title here".
		- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details
		  as possible. For example, start by explaining how you loaded the project,
		  which CDN you used, etc. When listing steps, don't just say what you did,
		  but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end
		  of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut,
			and if so which one?
		- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files
		 or GitHub repos, or copy/paste-able snippets, which you use in those examples.
		 If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
		- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out
		  what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
		- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
		- Include screenshots and animated GIFs (if relevant) which show you following the
			described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the
			keyboard while following the steps, record the GIF with a keybinding
			visualizer like [Keycastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr).
		- If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what
		  you were doing before the problem happened and share more information
			using the guidelines below.

		Provide more context by answering these questions:
		- Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new
		  version of {display-name}) or was this always a problem?
			- If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem
			  in an older version of {display-name}? What's the most recent version
			  in which the problem doesn't happen?
		- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how
		  often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
