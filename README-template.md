<!-- 
Badges are a great way to show tiny tidbits of info.
They also attract the eye but don't overuse them.

You can also make these badges link to relevant pages.

Quick note, remove the comments/move them all to the top so that the comments
render properly.
-->

<!-- 
Repo size is more "universal" than, say, npm package size. 
Feel free to change this.

You may be thinking, 

"why is there a badge for stars (and stuff)? 
aren't they already shown on the repo's homepage?"

Well, the fact is this README may be shown in other places.
For example, if this is an npm package, this README will also be shown on npm.
There may also be other places where this is shown.
If this README is supposed to be only on GitHub, feel free to remove these badges.

Before you start, check out the writing guidelines 
which lives at ./writing-guidelines.md for general writing tips.

<!--
You can place a logo or a banner image near the top of the README. 
Don't place both, if you want to just place the logo in the banner.
-->

<!-- 
Place a logo here. You can also make the logo move to the right by using:

<img src="src" align"right">
-->

{display-name} is a {tool/utility/feature} which helps you to {whatever it does}.
Additional line of info about your project. Don't go overboard, people won't
read it.

<!-- 
Place a list of highlights here
-->
- X and Y support
- Fast. See {link-to-benchmarks} for more info
- Small. Only `{n}kb`
- Dark/Light mode
- Minimal tooling
- etc.

<!--
Place a banner image here.

Prefer setting a background color for your image. 
This is because you don't know where your image will be placed.

You can put a short description above the banner if you like.
-->
![{display-name][banner]

<!-- 
Use this space after the banner to show 2-3 screenshots of what your project does.
A picture is worth a thousand words. 

Only exception is don't put screenshots if it's just code. 
Put the code in code blocks. 
Of course don't do this if you are showcasing some kind of linter for editors, etc.
-->

<!-- 
Once you have a clear and concise description of the project,
direct people to install the project and try it for themselves
-->
## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need to have X and Y installed. Also, your project must X, Y and Z.

### Installing

<!--
1. Give them a quick and easy way to install a production version
2. Show them how they can install previous versions and nightly builds
-->

To install {display-name}, run the following command:

<!--
Use the console language because it highlights the prompt
-->
```console
you@computer~$ {install-command}
```

To install a previous version, run the following command:

```console
you@computer~$ {install-command}@1.0.3
you@computer~$ {install-command}@version
```

<!-- 
If there are any alternate downloads, show them here.

For example, you may have the option to install a core lightweight option, etc.
Place them here.
-->

<!--
Always prefer reference-style links because
1. They are easy to maintain
2. There is always going to be that person 
   who is reading this in an editor/as a raw file.
