<!--
Hey there!
==========

Thanks for checking this out. If you find this helpful, please leave a star!
If you have any suggestions, feel free to open a pull request or an issue.

To make life easier, do a quick search-and-replace for:
{display-name}: The project's display name (ex. Angular)
{repo-name}: The name of the repo the project (ex. angular)
{github-username}: The username under which the repo is (ex. angular)
{install-command}: The command to install the project (ex. npm install @angular/cli)
Keep a lookout for text in curly braces.

**Make sure to read through the whole README.**
-->

<!--
Core concepts
=============

Your README should be a gateway to all other resource. It should answer these
questions as fast as possible:
1. What is the project for? (A short description)
2. Can I use it? (Prerequisites)
3. If yes, how do I install it? (Installation, Usage examples, etc.)
4. How can I help? (License, Contributing, etc.)
-->

<!--
Badges
======

Badges are a great way to show tiny tidbits of info.
They also attract the eye but don't overuse them.

You can also make these badges link to relevant pages.

Quick note, remove the comments/move them all to the top so that the badges
render properly.
-->

<!--
Repo size badge
===============

Repo size is more "universal" than, say, npm package size.
Feel free to change this.
-->
![GitHub repo size][repo-size]

<!--
Contributors badge
=================

Just to encourage others to contribute.
-->

<!--
Stars and forks badges
======================

You may be thinking,

"why is there a badge for stars (and stuff)?
aren't they already shown on the repo's homepage?"

Well, the fact is this README may be shown in other places.
For example, if this is an npm package, this README will also be shown on npm.
There may also be other places where this is shown.
If this README is supposed to be only on GitHub, feel free to remove these badges.

their respective references at the bottom of the page.

Writing guidelines
==================

Before you start, check out the writing guidelines
which lives at ./writing-guidelines.md for general writing tips.
-->

<!--
Images
======

You can place a logo or a banner image near the top of the README.
Don't place both, if you want to just place the logo in the banner.
-->

<!--
Logo
====

Place a logo here. You can also make the logo move to the right for a cool effect
by using `<img align"right">`
-->

<!--
Description
===========

This is where we start with the description. Keep it short, but convincing.
-->
{display-name} is a {tool/utility/feature} which helps you to {whatever it does}.
Additional line of info about your project. Don't go overboard, people won't
read it.

<!--
Banner
======

Place a banner image here.

Prefer setting a background color for your image.
This is because you don't know where your image will be placed.

You can put a short description above the banner if you like.
-->
![{display-name][banner]

<!--
Other Screenshots
=================

Use this space after the banner to show 2-3 screenshots (or GIFs)
of what your project does. A picture is worth a thousand words.

Only exception is don't put screenshots of code. Put the code in code blocks.
-->

<!--
Highlights
==========

Place a list of highlights here
-->

- Fast. See {link-to-benchmarks} for more info
- Small. Only `{n}kb`
- etc.

<!--
Installation
============

Once you have a clear and concise description of the project,
direct people to install the project and try it for themselves
