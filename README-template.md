Badges are a great way to show tiny tidbits of useful info.
They also attract the eye. Don't overuse them though.

When it does make sense, you can make these badges link to certain pages.

<!-- 
Repo size is more "universal" than, say, npm package size. 
Feel free to change this.

You may be thinking, 

"why is there a badge for stars (and stuff)? 
aren't they already shown on the repo's homepage?"

Well, the fact is this README may be shown on other places.
For example if this is an npm package, this README will also be shown on npm.
There may be other places this is shown too.
If this README is supposed to be only on GitHub, feel free to remove this

Some general guidelines:

1. Always break lines! Set your editor to show a ruler at ~80 characters.
   This is done so that if people are reading this as a raw file, they don't
	 have to scroll infifitely. 

	 Don't always break the line when you reach 80 characters.
	 Sometimes it make sense to break at other places. This paragraph is an example.

Check out [the documentation compendium][doc-compendium] for more tips.

<!--
Insert a logo/hero image here, if any. A banner is preferred.

If you are using a banner, you can optionally put text above the banner,
or you can place the banner at the top. If you put text above the banner,
make sure it's only 2-3 lines.

Always set a background color if any parts of the image 
do not contrast with black or white. This is done because some images 
which look good in light mode won't look good in dark mode and vice versa.

<!--
Always prefer reference style links, because
1. They are easy to maintain
2. There is always going to be that person 
   who is reading this in an editor/as a raw file.
