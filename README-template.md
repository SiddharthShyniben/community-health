<!-- 
Badges are a great way to show tiny tidbits of info.
They also attract the eye but don't overuse them.

You can also make these badges link to relevant pages.

Quick note, remove the comments/move them all to the top so that the comments
render properly.

<!-- 
Repo size is more "universal" than, say, npm package size. 
Feel free to change this.

You may be thinking, 

"why is there a badge for stars (and stuff)? 
aren't they already shown on the repo's homepage?"

Well, the fact is this README may be shown in other places.
For example, if this is an npm package, this README will also be shown on npm.
There may also be other places where this is shown.
If this README is supposed to be only on GitHub, feel free to remove these badges.

Here's a bunch of commonly used badges to save a visit to shields.io.
You can uncomment them if you want. Don't forget to uncomment and fill 
their respective references at the bottom of the page.

[![GitHub Workflow Status][workflow-status]][workflow-url]
![npm bundle size][npm-size]
[![npm downloads][npm-downloads]][repo-npm]
[![License][license]][license-url]
![Page Hits][page-hits]

There's more at shields.io and at other sources. You can use them if relevant.
Once again, don't add too much. Try to limit badges to a single line.

Some general guidelines:

1. Always break lines! Set your editor to show a ruler at ~80 characters.
   This is done so that if people are reading this as a raw file, they don't
	 have to scroll infinitely. 

	 This is not a hard and fast rule though, and it can be broken.
	 Sometimes it makes sense to break at other places. This paragraph is an example.
   Also, you don't have to break a line for that one last word which overflows 
	 (except if it is "Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" or something).

Check out [the documentation compendium][doc-compendium] for more tips.

<!--
Insert a logo/hero image here, if any. A banner is preferred.

Always set a background color if any parts of the image do not contrast 
with black or white. This is done because some images which look good 
in the light theme won't look good in the dark theme and vice versa.

<!--
Always prefer reference-style links because
1. They are easy to maintain
2. There is always going to be that person 
   who is reading this in an editor/as a raw file.
