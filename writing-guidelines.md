Here are some general writing guidelines:

1.  Keep your writing readable as a raw file.
    Sometimes, people may read your project as an unrendered, plain markdown
    file. It may be for editing, or just because they have a local copy 
    of your code. Make sure your code is still readable for them.

    A few tips to help make your markdown readable even if it is raw:

    - Always break lines! Set your editor to show a ruler at ~80 characters.
      This is done so that if people are reading this as a raw file, they don't
      have to scroll infinitely. 
      This is not a hard and fast rule though, and it can be broken.
      Sometimes it makes sense to break at other places. This paragraph is an example.
      Also, you don't have to break a line for that one last word which overflows 
      (except if it is "Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" or something).

    - Minimise HTML. Keep your markdown file as much markdowny as possible â€“ 
      you don't want people reading HTML! Only use HTML if it is really helpful
      to the readability of the rendered content. A good example of when to use
      an HTML tag is the `<details>` tag.

2.  Keep a light, friendly tone. Write as if the reader doesn't know too much but
    is really interested

3.  Keep it brief

4.  Link to other places in the files only for additional information. 
    When linking, inline the relevant information.

5.  Use as many images, snippets, commands as you can. Show them, not tell them.
